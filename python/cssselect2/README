cssselect2 is a straightforward implementation of CSS3 Selectors for markup
documents (HTML, XML, etc.) that can be read by ElementTree-like parsers
(including cElementTree, lxml, html5lib, etc.)

Unlike cssselect, it does not translate selectors to XPath and therefore does
not have all the correctness corner cases that are hard or impossible to fix in
cssselect.

Quick facts:

    - Free software: BSD licensed
