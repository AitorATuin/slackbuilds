Lua is a free software light-weight programming language designed
for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
general-purpose, stand-alone scripting language.

* WARNING *
This package is just for the slackware users needing the 5.2.x
version: it is not compatible with the 5.3.x one (install
just one version of the two) neither 5.1.x and with most of 
the software that needs lua on slackbuilds.org.
